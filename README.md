# Ali Abdolahi — Personal Website (static)

This is a static starter site based on a dark neon aesthetic using TailwindCSS, GSAP and vanilla JS. To use:

1. Copy files into a web-server root (or open index.html directly).
2. Edit `assets/css/style.css` and content files to suit your profile.
3. Replace placeholder images in `/assets/images` and the PDF in `/assets/pdf`.

Notes:
- All external libs are loaded via CDN for simplicity. If you prefer a build step, integrate Tailwind & bundle GSAP yourself.
- Accessibility & optimization checks recommended before public launch.

Enjoy — customize as you like.
